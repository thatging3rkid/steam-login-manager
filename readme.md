# steam-login-manager

A small Java program to manage your Steam accounts.

## Backstory

I stumbled upon W3D3's [SteamAccountSwitcher](https://github.com/W3D3/SteamAccountSwitcher) and it immediately became a daily driver. But, as I continued using it, I found two problems: 

- passwords were not encrypted (this has been fixed in later versions and v2)
- it's Windows only 

So, I decided to make my own!
